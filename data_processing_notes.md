# Jam Values

Per: https://www.census.gov/content/dam/Census/library/publications/2023/acs/acs_table_based_summary_file_handbook.pdf:

A “jam value” is a hard-coded value used to explain
the absence of data. The Table-Based Summary
File uses numeric jam values, whereas, the previous
sequence-based format used character values. For
example, a jam value is represented by a value in the
data display, such as “-666666666,” in cases where
the estimate could not be computed because there
was an insufficient number of sample observations.
The sequence-based format used a dot (.) to
express this information. Learn more about these
special data values on the Census Bureau’s “Code
Lists, Definitions, and Accuracy" webpage.
